# Baseline Performance Report - 2026-01-26

## Environment
- **Target**: https://thesimpsonsapi.com
- **Tool**: Apache JMeter 5.6.3
- **Configuration**: 10 Concurrent Users, 5-minute execution (reduced for capture).
- **Date**: 2026-01-26

## Executive Summary
This baseline establishes the initial performance characteristics of the Simpsons API. 
**Note**: High error rates (approx. 30%) were observed in "Random Page" scenarios across all APIs, returning 404. "Page 1" and "{id}" lookups were successful with 0% error.

## 1. Characters API Baseline
| Metric | Value | Target (from strategy) |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Avg Response Time | 232 ms | 200-800ms |
| 95th Percentile | 600 ms | < 1500ms |
| Throughput | 2.52 req/s | 10-15 req/s (at full load) |
| Error Rate | 31.32% | 0% |

**Sub-scenario Analysis**:
- **GET /characters (Page 1)**: Avg 102ms (0% Error)
- **GET /characters/{id}**: Avg 492ms (0% Error)
- **Random Pagination**: 100% Error (404)

## 2. Episodes API Baseline
| Metric | Value | Target (from strategy) |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Avg Response Time | 192 ms | 300-900ms |
| 95th Percentile | 545 ms | < 1800ms |
| Throughput | 2.51 req/s | 8-12 req/s |
| Error Rate | 33.73% | 0% |

**Sub-scenario Analysis**:
- **GET /episodes (Page 1)**: Avg 107ms (0% Error)
- **GET /episodes/{id}**: Avg 360ms (0% Error)
- **Random Pagination**: 100% Error (404)

## 3. Locations API Baseline
| Metric | Value | Target (from strategy) |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Avg Response Time | 196 ms | 150-600ms |
| 95th Percentile | 577 ms | < 1200ms |
| Throughput | 2.52 req/s | 12-18 req/s |
| Error Rate | 31.65% | 0% |

**Sub-scenario Analysis**:
- **GET /locations (Page 1)**: Avg 106ms (0% Error)
- **GET /locations/{id}**: Avg 375ms (0% Error)
- **Random Pagination**: 100% Error (404)

## Analysis & Recommendations
1. **Performance**: Working scenarios are well within target ranges.
2. **Regression**: The 404 errors on random pagination need investigation. It appears the API might not support the `page` parameter as currently configured in the test plan or the page ranges are invalid.
3. **Throughput**: Observed throughput is lower than target because the test was limited to 10 users with 3s think time.
